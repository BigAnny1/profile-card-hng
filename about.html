            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>
              My name is <strong>Chidi Anointing Uchechi</strong>, a creative mind
              passionate about building beautiful and functional digital
              experiences. My journey started from fashion and storytelling, and
              along the way, I discovered how design and technology can blend to
              solve real problems. Now I'm growing as a
              <strong>front-end developer</strong>, constantly learning how to
              turn ideas into clean, interactive web pages that make people's
              lives easier.

            <h2>Goals in this Program</h2>
            <p>
              My main goal is to gain strong confidence in writing modern,
              accessible, and responsive code. I want to master JavaScript and
              React, learn best practices for UI design, and become skilled
              enough to build realworld projects that make an impact. This
              program is a step toward building a career where creativity meets
              functionality.

            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>
              Sometimes I still struggle with debugging complex JavaScript logic
              and managing my time between learning and practice. I'm also
              learning to stay calm when I don't understand something
              immediately. But I remind myself that growth is a process every
              error and correction makes me better. I love the challenge.

            <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
            <p>
              Dear future me, keep your curiosity alive. Don't lose the hunger
              to learn or the humility to start small. You've come a long way 
              remember the nights of practice, the errors, the breakthroughs.
              Keep building, keep sharing, and keep growing; your journey is
              just beginning. Don't forget when you wrote your first code,
              Anointing!

            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              I'm grateful for communities like HNG and Axia Africa, where
              collaboration and learning are encouraged. This journey has shown
              me that tech isn't just about coding it's about people,
              creativity, and persistence. I hope to inspire others who are just
              starting, proving that consistency and faith can build anything.
